# Chat App with Node, Express, and the Vue CLI

Homework description
<br>
Use Node, Express and the Vue CLI with socket.io to create a live interactive chat application.
You’ll need to think about how components work, how the Vue CLI implements SASS, etc.
<br>
We’ll be building most of this in class as an intro to the Vue CLI. You’ll need to think about other
features to include as a more complete application.
<br>
Expand on the default functionality / class build. You could add (or finish) the login page / user
registration, include a notification message when a user leaves the chat, or add the ability to
add a custom avatar per user.
